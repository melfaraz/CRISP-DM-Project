## Libraries
The project was conducted utilizing Python 3.0 through the jupyter notebook . here is the list of libraries that I used in this project:

* Matplotlib
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Scikit-learn (Sklearn)

## Project Motivation:
My curiosity led me to explore the AirBnB dataset for Seattle, focusing on pricing dynamics, and price forecasting. 
Key inquiries addressed encompassed:

* How does pricing vary seasonally?
* When does Seattle experience its peak demand?
* What factors influence pricing across different neighborhoods?
* Which neighborhoods command the highest prices?
* How do property types within neighborhoods impact pricing?
* Is it feasible to predict listing prices, and if so, what factors are most impactful?

## Description of Files:
The Jupyter notebook delineates dataset exploration, preparation, wrangling, and predictive modeling to address the aforementioned questions. Markdown cells provide documentation and insights at each stage. The 'seattle' folder contains datasets sourced from Kaggle, including 'calendar.csv', 'listings.csv', and 'reviews.csv'.

## Summary of Findings:
Key discoveries include:

* Seattle's peak season spans from June to August, with July witnessing the highest activity.

* Portage Bay houses command the highest prices, followed by those in West Queen Anne and Westlake.
* Using Linear Regression, price prediction achieved an R2 score of 0.52 across both training and test datasets.
* Host details and listing descriptions significantly influence pricing dynamics.
